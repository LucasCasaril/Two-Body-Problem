In this project the mathematical equations and the numerical integration methods for the two-body problem are going to be implemented.

The integration method used in this project are not built-in, ready-to-use application, and were developed for better understanding of the problem, and the differences in solutions using distinct mechanisms.

The main file is "two-body-problem.py".

In this file, you can choose the integration method to use. But remember to comment the other ones. The integration methods are listed below:

    Euler's Method - "eulers_method.py"
    
    Built-In Integration - Scipy - odeint

    Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg with a fixed time step - "rfk_method_h_fixed.py"

    Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg with a variable time step - "rfh_method.py"
